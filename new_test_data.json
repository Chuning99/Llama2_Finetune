However, in the AI industry today there is still no good solution available to design efficient models targeting increasingly diverse edge hardware platforms. As a result, it takes repeated manual design and training iterations for models to be deployed, which in turn demands an extraordinary level of energy and engineering time for AI to reach production. \n \nOmniML is a well-funded early-stage startup targeting these big gaps. OmniML is backed by established VCs and world-leading researchers and industry experts. Founded by professor Song Han, MIT EECS professor and experienced start-up founder, Dr. Di Wu, former Facebook engineer, and Dr. Huizi Mao, co-inventor of the “deep compression” technology coming out of Stanford. OmniML makes major ML tasks 10x faster and 30% more accurate on different edge devices. The core product offering is a training platform that automates model co-design, training, and deployment targeting GPUs, AI SoCs, and even tiny MCUs. Our technology has already demonstrated significant gains in model performance and cost reduction in the initial collaboration with large customers in multiple vertical markets. \n \nTo embark on the journey, we are looking for bold leaders and strong technical individuals who share our vision and can grow together with us. You will be part of the founding team creating AI/ML software that will help hundreds of customers deploy powerful AI on 250+ billion edge devices.

Nylanauts can choose any workspace or environment that will result in more ideas, engagement, creativity, focus, collaboration, and productivity. It's true. They can go anywhere as long as they respect the working hours (time zones) of their team. Wherever motivates them; inspires them to be better versions of themselves. This means Nylanauts can work from the slopes of Missoula before traveling to the beaches of San Diego. Wonderful!\nAnd if Nylanauts want to work from an office in one of our hubs (San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Toronto, and London), they can. Go ahead! The workspace is there to be utilized.\nWhy Remote First, Office Second? Because we not only believe in respecting individual working styles, disabilities, and personal schedules, but also ensuring everyone has a better work-life balance. The outcomes will always be more important than the physical location.\nSo, if you’re looking to join a fast-growing company with a beloved, daily-use product, and an authentic mission that puts people first, we want to meet you.\nWant to know more?

However, in the AI industry today there is still no good solution available to design efficient models targeting increasingly diverse edge hardware platforms. As a result, it takes repeated manual design and training iterations for models to be deployed, which in turn demands an extraordinary level of energy and engineering time for AI to reach production. \n \nOmniML is a well-funded early-stage startup targeting these big gaps. OmniML is backed by established VCs and world-leading researchers and industry experts. Founded by professor Song Han, MIT EECS professor and experienced start-up founder, Dr. Di Wu, former Facebook engineer, and Dr. Huizi Mao, co-inventor of the “deep compression” technology coming out of Stanford. OmniML makes major ML tasks 10x faster and 30% more accurate on different edge devices. The core product offering is a training platform that automates model co-design, training, and deployment targeting GPUs, AI SoCs, and even tiny MCUs. Our technology has already demonstrated significant gains in model performance and cost reduction in the initial collaboration with large customers in multiple vertical markets. \n \nTo embark on the journey, we are looking for bold leaders and strong technical individuals who share our vision and can grow together with us.

Over 50,000 developers worldwide use the Nylas platform to quickly and securely build productivity features into their applications. With Nylas, developers get unprecedented access to rich communications data from their end-users, pre-built workflows that automate everyday tasks, embeddable UI/UX components for fast front-end development, and comprehensive security features - all delivered via a suite of powerful APIs that make integration easy.\n \nWho We Are\n \nNylas was founded in 2013 and has raised over $175M to date from Tiger Global, 8VC, Spark Capital, Slack, and more; as well as individual investors including Patrick Collison, Co-Founder and CEO of Stripe, John Collison, President and Co-Founder of Stripe, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna, and Tony Fadell. Developers around the world use Nylas to quickly and securely build email, scheduling, and work automation features into their applications. Nylas customers include Upwork, Wix, Freshworks, Lever, Dialpad, Ceridian, and Move.com.\n \nPeople First\n \nNylas is a BIG advocate for the well-being of its employees, which is why we have embraced a People First philosophy. It’s about giving more autonomy and flexibility to our employees. It’s not about when, where or how the work is accomplished; it’s about adopting a mindset of velocity and trust when tackling the work. It’s about respecting individual working styles, disabilities, and personal schedules, but also ensuring everyone has a better work-life balance. The outcomes will always be more important than the physical location.\n \nNylanauts have the ability to decide the best workspace or environment that will result in more ideas, engagement, creativity, focus, collaboration, and productivity. Why? Because we want our employees to be great; because we are focussed on being a high-performing team. To achieve this mission, we remove barriers and offer more autonomy. So, Nylanauts are encouraged to find those environments that inspire them to be great. This means Nylanauts can work from the slopes of Montana or from the beaches of Italy.\n \nAnd if Nylanauts want to work from an office in one of our hubs (San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Toronto, and London), they can! The workspace is there to be utilized.\n \nSo, if you’re looking to join a fast-growing company with a beloved, daily-use product, and an authentic mission that puts people first, we want to meet you.

We don’t want to do everything for our developers; we want them to be doing things for themselves. But to do that, we need to teach them some of our specialized knowledge on database subjects to do what they need to do with our databases without having to go through us - where that makes sense. Some things that are particularly fiddly or difficult we would probably want to hold on to for ourselves.\nResponsibilities\n. Maintain, scale, and administer our large sharded MySQL database environment to be operational 24/7 (more than 100TB of DB storage, 71 primary-replica pairs, hosting 200 shards!)\n.

Improve automation of our various database systems to help enable self-service (when it makes sense), and implement self-healing and resiliency\n. Improve automated backup and restore systems\n. Improve alerting - if it alerts and isn’t actionable, it’s not an alert! If something goes wrong and we don’t get alerted, we need a new alert! \n. Experiment and recommend new database engine upgrades and entirely new data stores (when they make sense)\n. Document current DB processes/architecture to help plan for the future\nQualifications\n. A few years of operating large-scale relational database systems (20+ servers) \n. Strong proficiency in MySQL database management including \n. Performance tuning, query optimization, index tuning\n. Maintaining HA solutions using mha, orchestrator\n. Setting up monitoring dashboards with meaningful metrics to help identify usage/performance trends\n. Proficient understanding of code versioning tools such as Git(Version Control)\n. Knowledge of MySQL features, limitations, and underlying storage engines\n. Familiarity with other SQL/NoSQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Vitess\n. Basic understanding of developer technologies - Python, Ansible, AWS, Terraform\n. Nice-to-have - experience building out data pipelines using Spark, Kafka, kubeflow, Beam, Dataflow\n. Nice-to-have - ProxySQL experience\nPerks/Benefits\n. Unlimited Paid Time Off (PTO): we take this very seriously as we care about the well-being of our employees\n. Healthcare: 90% of medical, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family\n. Retirement Plan: 401k & RRSP with a company match (super rare for a startup)\n. Holidays: 14 paid annual holidays (New Year’s Day, Family Day, President’s Day, Good Friday, Indigenous People's Day, etc)\n. Education Grant: annual learning & development perk\n.

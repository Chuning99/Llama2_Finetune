The core technology platform is based on the detection and processing of characteristic current signals generated by the interaction between nanopore biosensors and nucleic acid bases. Thus, high-throughput sequencing of nucleic acids can be achieved at the single-molecule level through a highly integrated chip system.\\nThis cutting-edge technology is highly expected to revolutionize the current sequencing filed by providing results with significantly higher data quality and lower cost as well as much higher convenience and timeliness. The parent company in China just hit a major milestone to launch the alpha version of our first generation product, making us highly encouraged and excited to continue our R&D, mature and upgrade the products, open up a blue ocean market and eventually reshape the current gene sequencing field to facilitate the new era of precision/personalized medicine. \\xa0 \\xa0\\nHere in the bay area research center, we are planning to attract talents interested in this frontier to take our R&D to a higher level. You will be provided with competitive salary, benefit and equity, as well as a bright career path and a warm, dynamic working environment.\\n\\xa0\\nResponsibilities:1. Develop, optimize and iterate algorithms to process raw current signals and convert them into nucleic acid sequences with high accuracy and efficiency.\\xa02. Develop, optimize and iterate algorithms for sequence alignment and obtain consensus sequence with high accuracy3.

The core technology platform is based on the detection and processing of characteristic current signals generated by the interaction between nanopore biosensors and nucleic acid bases. Thus, high-throughput sequencing of nucleic acids can be achieved at the single-molecule level through a highly integrated chip system.\\nThis cutting-edge technology is highly expected to revolutionize the current sequencing filed by providing results with significantly higher data quality and lower cost as well as much higher convenience and timeliness. The parent company in China just hit a major milestone to launch the alpha version of our first generation product, making us highly encouraged and excited to continue our R&D, mature and upgrade the products, open up a blue ocean market and eventually reshape the current gene sequencing field to facilitate the new era of precision/personalized medicine. \\xa0 \\xa0\\nHere in the bay area research center, we are planning to attract talents interested in this frontier to take our R&D to a higher level. You will be provided with competitive salary, benefit and equity, as well as a bright career path and a warm, dynamic working environment.\\n\\xa0\\nResponsibilities:1. Develop, optimize and iterate algorithms to process raw current signals and convert them into nucleic acid sequences with high accuracy and efficiency.\\xa02. Develop, optimize and iterate algorithms for sequence alignment and obtain consensus sequence with high accuracy3.
